The supermarket is implementing a computer vision system for processing customer photos. 
Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:

Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;
Monitor the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol.
Let's build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photo. 
We have at our disposal a set of photos of people with an indication of their age.

We will conduct a research analysis of a set of photos.
Prepare the data for training.
Let's train a neural network and calculate its quality.

In our investigation we used such libraries as: numpy, PIL, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, seaborn, tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image
