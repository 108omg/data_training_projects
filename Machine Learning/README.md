Let's prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for "Digit". The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises.
The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore. We have data with the parameters of extraction and purification at our disposal.
The model will help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.
We need to:
Prepare the data;
Conduct a research analysis of the data;
Build and train a model.
To complete the project, let's turn to the pandas, matplotlib and sklearn libraries.
