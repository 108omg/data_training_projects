We work in an online store that sells computer games all over the world. Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. We need to identify the patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.
We have data before 2016. Let's imagine that it's December 2016, and we are planning a campaign for 2017.

For investigation we used such libraries as: pandas, math, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot , seaborn, numpy, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d , scipy
